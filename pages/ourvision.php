                            Helping patients and health professionals work together to ensure a better administration of medication by patients themselves is our core mission.
                            To fulfill this mission we have created the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister that allows patients and doctors to have better exchanges based on reliable and guilt-free information concerning the real use of the medication.
                            The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister is our contribution towards making patients less dependant and more autonomous, increasing the performance of our health care systems and achieving better research.<br><br></h3>

                                How can a patient, during a follow-up visit to his doctor, recall correctly every time and date he took his medication, or simply when he forgot to take it or took too many doses? And yet, the doctor needs this information to correctly evaluate and adapt his prescription.
                                Patients don’t remember but their treatment has a story. It’s a story that influences clinical results and the safety of medication use;
                                For patients, it’s a story of risks: loss of treatment efficacy, bad medical decision, unnecessary side effects…
                                <br><br>
                                But for pharmacologists, clinicians, public health officers, health industrials, it’s a story that can become a nightmare. Everyone is responsible for medication misuse.
                                Certain poor adherence behaviour can lead to a breakdown of the benefit/risk ratio…
                                Preventing and correcting this behaviour is possible, but on one condition: it’s necessary to have a simple and reliable means of recording and analysing the way patients really take their medicine.
                                It’s for this reason we have developed the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister. A DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister records in real-time the exact behaviour of patients concerning their medical treatment.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                                    At last, doctors are able to take therapeutic decisions by knowing how their patients have taken their treatment. Differentiating pharmaco-resistance from incorrect adherence is no longer a case of guess work.
                                    It’s now simple to avoid non legitimate treatment intensification resorting to heavier and poorly tolerated doses or second-line products (more costly, leaving no other possibility for the patient…). The impact on public health treatment can therefore be improved.
                                    A better knowledge of how to use medication is an undeniable factor in health improvement with a positive impact on every phase in the life of a medication.
                                    In clinical research and post marketing authorisation, the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister provides immediate and factual visualization of each time the patient took his medication. It is easier to have a better understanding of the real action, positive or negative, of the medication.
                                    In post-marketing authorisation: the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister easily integrates into risk management actions.
                                    The purely factual adherence behaviour information opens a new field of knowledge and understanding of the impact of medication on the health of populations. With unquestionable data concerning medication administration, it becomes possible to implement minimization and corrective actions for medication use by the patients.
                                    As a tool for recording in real time the time and date that each medication is taken, the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister will change the practice of health professionals, pharmaco-epidemiologists, public health officers and industrials for the greater benefit of patients and society as a whole.
