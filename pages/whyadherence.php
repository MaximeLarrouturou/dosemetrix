                                Because, as confirmed by the WHO, adherence is far from being optimal and does not achieve the hoped for effectiveness in the majority of therapeutics prescribed by doctors. 
                                The waste is enormous and so are the risks and lost opportunities for patients to be well treated.

                                However, considerably improving adherence is no longer Utopian: the new possibility offered by the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister to easily record and with very few constraints, the date and time of each medication administration is an opportunity to finally launch effective actions to improve adherence.
                                Incorrect adherence constitutes a risk of misuse systematically associated to every prescription, whatever the medicine:  antineoplastic, anti-rejection drugs, antihypertensive, platelet aggregation inhibiting and anticoagulant drugs.

                                Generally this frequently proven misuse drastically reduces the benefit/risk ratio of any prescribed medication for an outpatient, essentially rendering, de facto, unrealistic, the possibility of obtaining the benefits described  in the clinical studies.

                                 Clinical trials represent the “ideal world” where the correct use of medication is ensured compared to the “real” world where there is little concern for how patients finally use their treatment;

                                     Our society is governed by the safety-first principle, if there is just one serious side-effect that could possibly occur within 10 000 patients for a prescribed medication, then this treatment already risks being taken off the market, especially if its real benefit seems to be weak. The fact that misuse, such as poor adherence is largely the patient’s responsibility bears little weight.ns;

                                     Therefore it would seem legitimate to ensure the patient complies correctly with the prescription each time a chronic treatment is introduced. This should be systematic.
                                     It is for this reason we propose the new tool: the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister. 
                                     It is the only method that does not require any un-packaging in order to automatically record how the medication is finally used by a patient. 
                                     As a tool for knowledge and understanding, the purpose of the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister is to contribute along with doctors, health care services, the payer, researchers, health industrials… to quantify, prevent and correct health risks resulting from systematic misuse of medication prescribed to patients..
