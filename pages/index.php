                             The adherence history can be immediately and intuitively understood without any prior training for the doctors. 
                             Mrs L’s administration behaviour is “obsessive”, The time of administration hardly ever varies from one day to the next. 
                             But when she forgets to take her medication for two days, she compensates by taking three tablets in one dose the following day ! 
                             You can imagine the side effects with this three tablets of hormonal inhibitors in one dose !
                             <br><br>
                             This surprising behaviour occurs fairly frequently and should systematically give rise to indications to manage this type of situation, for example :

                                 and incites him to inform Mrs D’s relations so they may assist her in following her treatment correctly.

                                 But this is seen by a gradual loss of autonomy in the capacity of the patient to ensure correct adherence to his treatment.

                        With <b>DOSEMETRIX</b>, any medication blister pack can be transformed into a <b>DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister</b>. 
                        For this, <b>DOSEMETRIX</b> makes electronic self-adhesive labels that are easily placed on the flat surface of the blister pack. 
                        <br>A very important fact is that the self-adhesive labels are attached to the blister pack by the patients themselves after receiving their medication from the pharmacist (the procedure is slightly different for clinical trials due to legislation).

                        The packaging features a window corresponding to the size of the blister pack which is to receive the label. 
                        The patient simply blocks his/her blister pack in the window and pulls on a tab: as if by magic, the ordinary blister becomes a Smart Blister. 
                        An Exjade blister pack becomes an Exjade Smart Blister in just ten seconds, a Glivec 400 mg blister pack becomes a Glivec 400 mg Smart Blister and so on… 
                        So, all patients can easily cope with this new technology. <a href=""><b>Download our brochure</b> </a>
                        <br><br>Each medication corresponds to a type and size of blister, and consequently has its own specifically designed electronic label.
                        A reader with a USB cable ensures the immediate transfer of all the recorded adherence information on the electronic label directly to the computer of the clinician or the investigator or CRO or to a server via the web-based application.

                                <i>To this effect, <b>DOSEMETRIX</b> labels are conditioned to enable easy and correct positioning of the electronic label on each blister. 
                                The packaging features a window corresponding to the size of the blister pack which is to receive the label. 
                                The patient simply blocks his/her blister pack in the window and pulls on a tab: as if by magic, the ordinary blister becomes a Smart Blister. 
                                An Exjade blister pack becomes an Exjade Smart Blister in just ten seconds, a Glivec 400 mg blister pack becomes a Glivec 400 mg Smart Blister and so on…
                                So, all patients can easily cope with this new technology.</i>
