                                Medication is tested in an « ideal » world, that of clinical trials, but they are used in the real world. 
                                The environment and the context are different. Surprises are possible (and normal). 
                                It’s for this reason that for the last years, the goal of risk management is to confirm that, in the real world – our world-, the benefit of a treatment greatly exceeds the risk as much for the group of treated patients as a whole as for each individual patient.

                                Non optimal adherence is the most usual misuse.
                                This misuse results in a decrease (rarely documented) of the benefit. 
                                This entails a patient losing the benefit of his treatment while being subjected to all the risks

                                    Another argument in favour of using the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister in your post-marketing studies is financial. 
                                    The additional cost linked to the electronic measurement of adherence can be counter balanced by the need for fewer patients (better quality data, reduction in missing data… increase of statistical strength) and by a simplification of CRFs.

                            In the scope of risk management, automatic recording of adherence data with the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister firstly allows accurate quantification of misuse and the consequent risks for patients. 
                            The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister is easily integrated as an objective means of measuring adherence for real life studies or panels. 
                            Studies are in  real life studies or panels. 
                            Studies are in any case carried out and generally include a subjective measure of adherence. 
                            The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister enriches and the adherence measurement and makes it more accurate through precise practical data. 
                            Patients have very heterogeneous and changeable behaviour regarding their medication. 
                            As shown by the histories presented on this site, every long term medication is exposed to risks of misuse, whatever the vital prognosis of the under-lying pathology.
                            <br><br>
                            There are patient populations that present a high risk of unintentional misuse. 
                            These populations merit specific studies.
                            <br><br>
                            Without a correct visualization of the precise behaviour of patients, it is very difficult to create corrective interventions because we don’t really know what has to be corrected! Blind intervention has little chance of success.

                            The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister is an indispensable tool for any corrective action regarding medication misuse by the patients themselves. 
                            Without individual and factual information on the adherence behaviour of patients, how can we give them targeted advice and information that is truly effective? 
                            How can we even effective? 
                            How can we even identify high risk patients?
                            <br><br>
                            This is why DOSEMETRIX proposes the « Good Use Programme » which is a standardized intervention for identification and correction of medication misuse focused on the patient and supported by the recording of adherence data using the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister.

                                 and incites him to inform Mrs D’s relations so they may assist her in following her treatment correctly.

                                 But this is seen by a gradual loss of autonomy in the capacity of the patient to ensure correct adherence to his treatment.
