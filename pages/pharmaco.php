                                Non optimal adherence reduce the magnitude of treatment effects. 
                                It is therefore legitimate to determine accurately, without bias, the adherence and use of medication which is sensitive, or at risk of misuse, by patients in “real life”. 
                                Concerning the way in which patients use the medication which has been prescribed to them, the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister will give you reliable results beyond your expectations.
                                <br><br>
                                With the data recorded by the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister, you can rank your patients by order of their adherence and correlate their medicinal intake pattern with levels of efficacy and safety use.
                                <br><br>
                                You can calibrate and evaluate corrective actions to be implemented in order to improve medication adherence.

                                    Another argument in favour of using the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister in your post-marketing studies is financial. 
                                    The additional cost linked to the electronic measurement of adherence can be counter balanced by the need for fewer patients (better quality data, reduction in missing data… increase of statistical strength) and by a simplification of CRFs.

                                    In all cases, when the « adherence » criteria must be evaluated, there is no other method of recording the adherence of each patient included in the study in such an objective, accurate and reliable way.
