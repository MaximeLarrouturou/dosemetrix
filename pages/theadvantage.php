                                The data recorded by a DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister clic Clinical research is equivalent to a patient diary but without the patient having to complete any task or intervention each time the medicine is taken. 
                                It’s the guarantee of the reliability of information recorded in real time. 
                                The patients are always well-informed about the fact that the time and date of each administration is recorded but the measure must be carried out automatically and without constraint. 
                                The longitudinal drug adherence data recording must not depend on a specific action from the patient, such as answering their smart phone or pressing a button at each administration or putting the blister in a box equipped with a coded opening especially as patients know their medication blister packs and changing the contents could change the way they take their medication.

                                <b>The DOSEMETRIX smart blister possesses numerous additional advantages :</b>
                                <br><br>
                                The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister is an innovative tool in phase with today’s information and communication technologies. 
                                The medication adherence data is easily accessible for the clinician, investigator, pharmaco-epidemiologist… 
                                There are numerous potential telemedicine applications for remote monitoring of treatment administration and follow-up. 
                                One of the goals is also to help patients retain their autonomy for as long as possible.
                                <br><br>
                                With the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister, the constraints are negligible. 
                                It is very simple to use, whether it be for the patient, the doctor or the pharmacist…

                        </div>
                         <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
                             <br><p class="text wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.65s">
                                    However it is visualized, the adherence history can be immediately and intuitively understood without any prior training.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Due to the small size of the electronic component and the extreme thinness and flexibility of the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister label the patient can easily carry his medication with him where ever he goes (in a handbag, inside jacket pocket…).
                                    <br><br>        
                                    With the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister, the blister delivered by the pharmacist is the container used by the patient. 
                                    The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister requires no un-packaging or repackaging of tablets, the medication always remains in its original packaging (no possible error for the identification of a treatment, no physicochemical or pharmacological modification of the active substance, no risk of alteration caused by prolonged exposure to the air or contact with outside elements, no stability study to carry out, no legislation conflict…)
