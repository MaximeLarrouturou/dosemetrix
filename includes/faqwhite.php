              How is the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister used to measure adherence in « real life »?
            </h2>
                <p>
                  The medication delivery chain remains unchanged : 
                  the medication used is the one spontaneously prescribed at the sole initiative of the doctor and then delivered at the dispensary by the pharmacist in the usual way. 
                  The only semi-constraint is that, beforehand, doctors must receive the DOSEMETRIX self-adhesive labels to be affixed to the medication blister packs delivered by the pharmacist. 
                  The doctors give the labels to his patient after prescription.
                  <br><br>
                  The data obtained is equivalent to that recorded in a patient diary apart from the fact that the patients don’t have to think about ticking a box and indicating the time and date of each administration.
                  <br><br>
                  Each electronic label is specific to a medication and the size and shape of its blister to avoid a study being deviated from one medication to another.
                  <br><br>
                  The rest couldn’t be simpler : 
                  the patient uses the prepaid envelope to send off the empty Smart Blister or just the part corresponding to the electronic chip, in the same way he would send off a satisfaction evaluation or life quality questionnaire. 
                  Experience shows that it is not a problem for the patient to send their smart blister back by post or to hand it in to their doctor or pharmacist during a consultation or follow up visit. 
                  The reading can be centralized or carried out by the doctor or pharmacist if they possess an ad hoc reader that can read Smart Blisters.

                Can the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister be designed for any blister ?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  Each blister corresponds to a DOSEMETRIX smart blister that has been specifically designed for it. 
                  But this is possible for any medication sold in thermally moulded packs, whether it is a hard tablet or a capsule, whatever the size of the tablet or capsule, whether it comes in pre-cut packs or not, child-resistant packaging or not, whether the tablet is extracted through pressure or by stripping away an aluminium protective film, whether the pack is inserted or not in a wallet-type casing… in other words, whatever the inventiveness or fantasy of blister designers. 
                  And their imagination seems limitless.
                  <br><br>
                  To date, we have never given up on the design of a new DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister because of the blister shape.

                Does DOSEMETRIX accept to design and manufacture electronic labels for any kind of use ?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  DOSEMETRIX has ethics. We will refuse in the following cases:
                  <br><br>
                  When we do not have full assurance that the implementation of the electronic measure will be conducted in agreement with the legislation or in an environment of quality (protocol, quality of contact with doctors, explanation of its use, information to patients…). 
                  We want to avoid any risk of being used for purposes other than a scientific objective and health improvement.
                  <br><br>
                  When the project carries a risk of coercive and intrusive control of patients, whatever the eventual good reasons invoked, even if it is for a treatment deemed necessary for marginal populations. 
                  In any case, a patient who wants to cheat will cheat, he will understand that all he has to do is to extract the medication from the blister at the appropriate times and throw it away.
                  <br><br>
                  We do not renounce our initial training as doctors. 
                  The priority given to the individual’s free will is non negotiable. 
                  Intentional non adherence must be clearly identified in order to respect it whereas unintentional poor adherence must incite to better inform and help patients.
                  <br><br>
                  We also believe that projects aiming to ensure the correct ingestion of a tablet by associating it to any intrusive technology leads to an undesirable society model. 
                  And again, a patient who wants to cheat will cheat.

                Why not use patient diaries as opposed to an electronic adherence measure ?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  Because patients perceive diaries as a constraint and they contain too many non responses to be correctly analysed. 
                  In addition, patients tend to complete these diaries just before the consultation and not at the time of taking the medication, which cannot guarantee the reliability of the recorded data.
                  <br><br>
                  Patients refuse to add any extra action or obligation to their daily gesture of taking medication. 
                  This constraint is not considered as acceptable by all the patients. 
                  The very fact of having to take medication daily is already a constraint, adding to that is culturally inacceptable. 
                  Patients even refuse a simple act of pushing a button, placing a blister in box to record when it’s opened and closed, or picking up a pencil to tick a box. 
                  In all cases, this additional gesture must be concomitant to the taking of the medication. 
                  If it isn’t, the recorded data will not be reliable.

                Why not use global adherence evaluation questionnaires?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  Global adherence evaluation questionnaires do not have the same goal. 
                  Doctors have always refused to integrate them in their practice.
                  <br><br>
                  These questionnaires lack precision. 
                  They are useful in pharmaco-epidemiological studies where the relative degree of precision concerning patient behaviour patterns is not required because it is compensated for by the large number of participants.
                  <br><br>
                  We are just at the beginning of the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister adventure and we will always be willing to compare any kind of data recording system or model with that of the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister.

                Is there a gold standard when measuring adherence in “real life”?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister is a good candidate for the gold standard title when the medication is delivered in thermally moulded packs.
                  <br><br>
                  When medication is delivered in bottles, the gold standard is the electronic stopper (MEMS), as is shown in the wealth of literature.
                  <br><br>
                  The two systems, DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister and MEMS, are not in competition but complementary. 
                  They respectively address medication delivered in blister packs and in bottles.

                Can every doctor and pharmacist taking part in the study be equipped with an ad hoc DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister reader?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  Yes, of course! It’s as possible to equip ten doctors or pharmacists, as it is a thousand. 
                  The only limitation is financial. 
                  But fortunately, the unit cost per reader can be low if it is sold in volume.
                  <br><br>
                  There is, however, one condition, that is the motivation of the doctor or the pharmacist to learn how to work with the reader software application. 
                  Very often, users prefer to have at their direct disposal, the PDF records of administration complete with a study, an interpretation, clear explanations… 
                  It’s human.

                Are there any competitor products to measure adherence of medication delivered in blister packs by dispensaries?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  Not to our knowledge. 
                  The DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister is undeniably a veritable technological innovation
                  <br><br>
                  Furthermore, each DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister electronic label is supplied in an individual pack, which serves as a support when affixing the label. 
                  An elderly patient or a physically handicapped patient can also make the transformation of a blister pack into a Smart Blister.
                  <br><br>
                  Without this patented improvement, the uses of the Smart Blister would be very limited.

                  Will “Good Use” programmes become a public health necessity?
                  <br><br>
                  In an « ideal » world, every medication should be commercialized with its « Good Use » programme. 
                  Each “Good Use” programme should be adapted to each medical treatment. 
                  Medication should be systematically measured via its « Good Use » programme to obtain its marketing authorization. 
                  It’s a shift in standards, but who could have predicted 15 years ago, when the drug safety system in place seemed to be entirely sufficient, that nobody today would contest the utility and the absolute necessity for risk management plans. 
                  It’s ironic that several major health crises have had a very positive impact. 
                  Do we have to wait for another health crisis for our health system to attack the problem of non-optimal adherence?

              <h2 class="faqtitre">
                How can the same means of measurement, the Smart Blister, be integrated into both a clinical study designed to provide adaptable data concerning use and then into a programme aiming to prevent misuse ?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  The Smart Blister, like all technology, is fairly neutral. 
                  It all depends on how we use it.
                  <br><br>
                  When the goal is to measure medication adherence in everyday conditions, it’s a question of simply excluding from the protocol all the measures designed to reinforce adherence. 
                  In particular, it’s necessary to exclude any communication of individual data and to limit the messages that draw attention to the good use concept. 
                  Ideally, there should be a panel of pharmacists who propose the programme to their customers without any mention of an objective of improved adherence. 
                  There exists no other method and evaluation framework for medication adherence which is as neutral or lacking in bias regarding patient behaviour.
                  <br><br>
                  When the goal is to pre-empt and correct patient behaviour, the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister should be included in a “Good Use” programme as described. 
                  Clic Risk Management / Drug misuse correction Program It’s essential to multiply good use reinforcement measures: 
                  inform doctors and make them aware of the issues attached to good use, communicate the individual data to doctors concerning their own patients, create positive experiences of better adherence to show that it is possible and relatively simple to improve patient behaviour…
                  <br><br>
                  In all cases, the electronically recorded data is independent of the doctor’s or pharmacist’s subjectivity and the patient’s willingness to please them. 
                  It’s no longer necessary to question the patient about his adherence. 
                  Nor doctors or pharmacists have to devote a part of their time to counting pills (tablets or capsules) during consultations or follow up interviews. 
                  Patients no longer feel they are placed in a situation of guilt and doctors can use the time saved to play a much worthier role.
                </p> 
              <h2 class="faqtitre">
                Does the electronic adherence system modify patient adherence? 
              </h2>
                <p>
                  Any adherence measure can modify adherence even if most pharmaco-epidemiological studies which include adherence measurement (through questions to the doctor and/or patients) do not take this bias into consideration !
                  <br><br>
                  In a clinical study trial, devoting time and attention to measuring medication adherence inevitably improves it. 
                  It is, moreover, the aim. 
                  The patients recruited for clinical trials are also specific and not comparable to “standard” patients. 
                  The fact that they show better adherence from the outset is stated in many publications. 
                  This is nevertheless a good thing because what could be concluded from a study trial where the execution of the protocol does not comply to the protocol ?
                  <br><br>
                  On the other hand, there are pharmaco-epidemiological situations where it is absolutely essential to avoid influencing spontaneous adherence.
                  <br><br>
                  Therefore we consider that electronic measurement must be associated to two common sense precautions:
                  <br><br>
                  Firstly, the protocol and the operating mode require « normal » and not over-exaggerated attention concerning the « adherence parameter »…
                  <br><br>
                  And secondly, all you have to do is either add a longer term measurement, knowing that all adherence bias will eventually disappear, or carry out a study using a panel of pharmacists.
                  <br><br>
                  In conclusion, ensuring that the electronic adherence measurement results or doesn’t result in adherence modification is often merely a question of common sense but these are two exclusive choices.
                  <br><br>
                  Whatever the case, already when we study certain situations, even if they seem to reflect improved adherence behaviour because it is biased, they already indicate a need for the implementation of interventions to correct risks

              <h2 class="faqtitre">
                Is there a minimum or maximum number of Smart Blisters for a study ?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  There is no minimum or maximum. 
                  In the scope of a clinical study, the number of Smart Blisters depends only on the protocol (length of treatment, dosage…). 
                  In a pharmaco-epidemiological study (postmarketing study), the number of blisters required depends on the number of patients included. 
                  When the recorded data lacks precision with a high rate of missing data, the number of included patients is inflationary. 
                  This explains the interest of the electronic measure of adherence to remain within a realistic number of patients.

              <h2 class="faqtitre">
                Is it possible to compare “real life” adherence of Product A versus Product B using Smart Blisters ?
              </h2>
                <p>
                  Generally, yes. 
                  Such a study is difficult to carry out without a Smart Blister (when the medication is delivered in blister form, of course).
                  <br><br>
                  Furthermore, it would be interesting to study adherence between free and fixed combinations, which is methodologically difficult without an accurate and particularly reliable measuring tool. 
                  This is why the debate on the real interest of the fixed combinations of antihypertensives in terms of adherence still continues. 
                  It would be necessary to carry out an irreproachable methodological study including an electronic measure of adherence by Smart Blister
                  <br><br>
                  It would also be interesting to compare two products possessing a different tolerance profile in order to measure the impact on spontaneous use by the patients.
                  <br><br>
                  Many products claim better adherence than their competitors through apparently logical arguments but their claims are rarely supported by methodologically sound studies…
                  <br><br>
                  Likewise, the comparison between several modes of administration could reserve surprises, like the comparison between a product with one administration per day, taken at a time decided by the patient, and a product with two administrations per day, morning and night. 
                  The latter seems fairly harmful from the point of view of the patients behaviour but must also be analysed with regard to the pharmacokinetic data of the product. 
                  But this would require even more high quality, unbiased behavioural data.

                  This was the first condition stipulated in the initial mission statement. 
                  With the DOSEMETRIX Smart Blister, there is no un-packaging or repackaging of tablets (or capsules) from one blister to a different container (different blister or pillbox…).
